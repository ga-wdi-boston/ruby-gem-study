As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
The gem I picked is Formtastic, which basically makes creating functional,
semantically pleasing, and useful HTML forms easy. Basically, you provide the gem
with all the inputs that you want to include, what kind of inputs you want them
to be, and then can customize them fairly deeply from there. A good alternative gem
seems to be simple_form, which is another gem used to create forms. It's actually
very similar syntactically to Formtastic but does not have an SCSS stylesheet that
is a pretty central component of Formtastic and thus offers similar functionality,
similar syntax so switching over would be relatively easy, and is actually more
simple than Formtastic without losing the ability to customize it.
