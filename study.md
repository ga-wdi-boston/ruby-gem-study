RSpec
"RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an approach
to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain Driven Design,
and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation,
focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD."

RSpec alternative:
minitest
"minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD,
mocking, and benchmarking"

http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html

While less robust than rspec, minitest has a lot of the same basic functionality
and is more lightweight with a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite.
