As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

  I chose capybara and found an alternative named selenium-webdriver. Both are
tools for testing web applications, simulating user interactions with a server.

selenium-webdriver was released 10 months ago and has consistant releases, active development, and almost as many downloads as capybara. There is extensive
documentation for not only the webdriver, but many of selenium's other functions as well. it looks like a solid alternative to capybara.
