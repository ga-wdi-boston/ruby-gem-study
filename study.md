As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

Gem Researched Capybara: a testing tool for rack based web applications to simulate
how a user would interact with a website.

The gems that I researched to compare with Capybara were Selenium and Watir. All three
of these gems are to test/simulate how users would interact with the web app.

After doing the reading, Capybara is one of the more popular gems to choose when
deciding how you would like to test your browser because of it's simplicity.
Selenium has a very active development activity, but, compared to Watir and Capybara,
have the most issues (251 versus the low 30s in the other two gems). So, I wouldn't
recommend Selenium as a gem, but Watir is the next best alternative to Capybara because
it is has a similar development activity as Capybara, but less issues. Additionally,
Watir's last commit was 3 months ago versus Capybara's last commit was over a year ago.
Watir doesn't need an external server to run these tests. However, it only runs on Ruby, so if the project was on Python or Java -- then Selenium would be the best choice for how
widely it is used.
