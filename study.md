As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
Capybara - An integration testing tool that simulates how a user
might interact with a website.

Lebowski is similar but not as well documented or popular as Capybara

I would pick Capybara because it seems more widely used, but I don't
understand the particulars of any of these gems so its hard to say.
