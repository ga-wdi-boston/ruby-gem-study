Paperclip is an easy way to add attachments to a model and bundle them nicely for the front end. There can be up to four attributes including: file name, file size, content type, and updated at.

In comparison to the other gems, I would still use Paperclip. This is because none of the other ones come even close in comparison. The popularity ratings compared to Paperclip are 5 points below at highest and haven't been committed, most, in over 2 plus years.
