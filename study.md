As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

Two alternatives to the paperclip gem are Carrierwave and Refile.

Carrierwave is an older gem with more downloads and more support, however the last commit was 2 years ago and dev activity is less active.

Refile is a new gem but the dev community is more active and the last commmit was 1year ago.

I would personally recommend Carrierwave over Refile just because it is more established and will therefore have more support.
