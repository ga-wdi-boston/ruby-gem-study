As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

I found it extremely difficult to find 2 ruby gems that do something so similar you could call one or the other an alternative. I did find Resque interesting though. It was a way to sort of throw a job on a shelf and come back to do it later when it doesn't have to be done right away. It uses a Redis library to store all of these "background jobs". Some of these jobs could be warming caches, counting disk usage, firing of web hooks, or deleting users.
