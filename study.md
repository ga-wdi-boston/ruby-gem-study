As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
Geocoder: Provides object geocoding (by street or IP address), reverse geocoding (coordinates to street address), distance queries for ActiveRecord and Mongoid, result caching, and more. It has built in functionality for Yahoo and Google API keys, distance calculation helpers, reverse geolocation, etc. It appears to be the heavitest use mapping gem, with over 3 million downloads. It has been consistently updated, with the most recent change on 4/11/2016.

Alternatives:
Geokit, which provides geocoding and distance calculation in an easy-to-use API. It has over 2 million downloads, and is often preferred for it's simplicity.

Or, gmaps4rails, which enables easy Google map + overlays creation. It was developed for simplicity in creating google maps with overlays.
