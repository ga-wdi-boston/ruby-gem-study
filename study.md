As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
I researched paperclip.  It allows developers to upload files to their application, and is seemingly most frequently used to upload and manipulate images.  It has over 10.5 million downloads from rubygems.org and almost 1800 commits on its repository.

Alternative gems that perform a similar function are refile, CarrierWave and Dragonfly.  Of these, I would select CarrierWave.

I would justify this choice to a senior engineer by referring to its record of exceptionally diligent maintenance.  The most recent commit was today and over the last year it appears to average at least one commit per week.  It has 58 outstanding issues but those compose only 4% of total issues.  Paperclip averages slightly fewer commits per week and has 115 outstanding issues (8% of total issues).  In terms of functionality, developers praise CarrierWave for it's superior customizability and image processing capabilities.  However those points are only anecdotal and I would want to try both myself to see if those distinctions are apparent and if they really make a difference in the gem's usefulness before including them in my recommendation.
