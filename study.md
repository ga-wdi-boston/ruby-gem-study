As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
I researched the devise gem, which is an authentication framework for rails. It provides user management, and key encrypton for web applications. It is a rack based gem built on top of Warden, which means it is run as a standalone module seperate from rails and is executed before the cheif rails application is invoked. Omniauth is probably the next best alternative, but doesn't seem to be as well maintained as devise. Cancan seems to be an even worse option. If I were to try to convince an engineer to use a particular gem is would be based on how widely used it is, if it is currently being maintained, how thorough the documentation is, and how many issues are currently open on the github page.
