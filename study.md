As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
I researched capybara, which turned out to be a gem to do browser testing. It
mimics a user.

I think the next best alternative for browser testing is selenium-webdriver. Its
last commit was 3 minutes ago, when I visited its github page, and when compared
to other alternative gems for browser testing, that was by far the most recent
commit. Admittedly, there are a lot of open issues, and they make up nearly 30% of
all issues, but they clearly do update based on the timing of last commits as I visited.
It is open source code, maintained by volunteers, so I think they get a lot of attention.

They do have a detailed protocol for those who want to submit pull requests, though.

It is also the second-most-popular browser testing gem, behind capybara, and millions
of downloads ahead of the third-most-popular.
