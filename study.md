As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think

alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

for Rails with Warden.' There are several author gems for authentication/

devise is the best currently available option as its fast and allows for
more customization.
