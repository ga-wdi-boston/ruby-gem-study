As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

Gem Researched: Capybara

- Capybara helps test web apps by mimicking how a user would interact with the app.
- It implements methods like "visit", "click_link", "find_button" to allow you to construct tests of user interaction with the site.
- Based on The Ruby Toolbox, Capybara is the most popular browser testing gem, with the second and third-most popular gems being selenium-webdriver and Poltergeist, respectively.
- selenium-webdriver was released at about the same time as Capybara and according to Ruby Toolbox it has seen more active on github. However, going directly to Capybara's page it seems like it has also seen very recent activity; perhaps the Toolbox data is not up-to-date.
- Selenium has almost as many downloads as Capybara, and indeed Capybara allows you to implement selenium as a a web driver (I don't fully understand this--maybe they're different categories of thing?).
- Poltergeist has fewer downloads, and fewer commits/less recent activity.
- Selenium appears to be the best alternative to Capybara.
