As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

Paperclip has multiple versions, including 2 betas. It is licensed by MIT. Its slugline is "Easy upload management for ActiveRecord". Toolbox says it has over 11M downloads! Github says Paperclip allows "being able to refer to your files as easily as you refer to your other attributes."
Paperclip has many more commits on GH than its alternative, attachment_fu. However a review from Infinum.co says Paperclip is not that useful in complex jobs, not is it well maintained. Carrierwave is an alternative but over engineered with too many functions. Refile tries to combine the last two and does not succeed, according to hard-to-please Infinum.co.
If I were recommending a file cache library, I would go with Paperclip because it is the most simple to use, and there are other things in coding one can bang their head about, not uploading images.```
