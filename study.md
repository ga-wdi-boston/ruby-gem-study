As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

The most useful gem that I came across is The Coding Designer's Survival Kit.
It is a set of starter HTML files, Sass mixins & patterns, as well as open source
Javascript libraries.  The purpose is to make creating a web page easier and more
efficient. I would justify this to an engineer by citing time and stress saved.  The
ease of completing projects would be improved.
Other gems I researched are Cocaine, which acts a bit like a linter for the
Command Line, and Midwife, which is a collection of preprocessors for front
end development.
