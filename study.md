As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?



Devise is an authentication gem that is used for the "well-experienced" Ruby team.  Because we are new, and because our software team is just trying to make an application with authentication for our 20 man company, it's not necessary to use the high-level devise authentication gem.

A suitable alternative would be "authentication" -- a gem that makes it's reputation as an authentication method for "minimalist authentication."  This authentication system documentation reads that it can be setup on a ruby app in two easy steps :


1  Include Authentication to your controller.
2  Define #find_current_user in your controller.
