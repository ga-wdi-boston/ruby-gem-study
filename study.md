As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
I am going to compare auth gems.

Devise is the suggested one. I think AuthLogic may be next best.

It seems like Devise is more popular (17.1 M vs. 2.1 M downloads). Devise also
has more recent commits, and many more. However, it seems like authLogic is simpler
to get going. The documentation just jumps in with some really simple code samples.
I would probably tell the senior engineer that it is good enough for what we are doing
(if that is true) and that it isn't worth the time to figure out the different modules in Devise.

I am only saying that because I need to argue for something though, I don't think I really
know enough to have an opinion yet.
