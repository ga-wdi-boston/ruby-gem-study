As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
The Ruby gem Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real world user would interact with the app. It has been downloaded over 16 million times from rubygems.org, with over 2,250 commits.

Some alternative gems include:
- selenium-webdriver
- Webrat
- headless

Since we want to be using gems that are well-maintained, I might justify the use of setlenium-webdriver by pointing out that the development activity of selenium-webdriver is 'very active' (last commit about a month ago), compaed to capybara's 'less active' (last commit about a year ago) [per https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/browser_testing].
