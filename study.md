As an exercise, pick one of the gems listed above and research it;
then, research some alternative gems, and pick the gem that you think
is the next best alternative. How might you justify this choice of best
alternative gem to a senior engineer on your team?

```txt
Capyabara is the gem I chose.  Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app. It is agnostic about the driver running your tests and comes with Rack::Test and Selenium support built in. WebKit is supported through an external gem.  I could not find any comprables to capybara, but I am sure there are some and I just wasn't able to find them. I would justify using capyabra to a senior engineer by letting him know the benefits of being able to test your work to ensure proper function.
